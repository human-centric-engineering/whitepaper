# White Paper
This is a white paper for outlining and developing the philosophy, principles and practices of [Human-Centric Engineering](https://www.humancentricengineering.com/) 

The intention is to develop a common language for companies, leaders, and individuals to talk about the human side of software engineering. The aim is to create a philosophy and set of principles to align behind, and to curate a collection of practices that provide a practical implementation element.

An organisation aligned to HCE thinking would aim to adhere to the philosophy and principles and pick & choose the practices.
