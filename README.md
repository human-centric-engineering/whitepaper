# White Paper
This is a white paper for outlining and developing the philosophy, principles and practices of [Human-Centric Engineering](https://www.humancentricengineering.com/) 

The intention is to develop a common language for companies, leaders, and individuals to talk about the human side of software engineering. The aim is to create a philosophy and set of principles to align behind, and to curate a collection of practices that provide a practical implementation element.

The Philosophy itself is not very actionable, it is more directional and aspirational. It is flexible in interpretation. The 10 principles of human-centric thinking relate to deeply held beliefs and are foundational pillars to fall back on when making decisions or taking actions. The Practices are designed to be varied and actionable, and therefore less open to interpretation. To avoid the “A”gile dogma trap, Practices are subject to change and updates, whereas the Philosophy is unlikely to change.

An organisation aligned to HCE thinking would want to adhere to the philosophy and principles and pick & choose the practices.
