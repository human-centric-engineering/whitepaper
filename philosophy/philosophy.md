# Philosophy
The philosophy is directional and aspirational, designed to exist beyond the confines of the Human-Centric Engineering business entity. It positions the way of thinking and the “why”.

## The Human-Centric Engineering Philosophy Statement
Software engineering is not just a technical endeavour, but a deeply human one. It’s more than the software and the engineering. It’s about the people who come together to build the software. The creators are as important as the creation itself.

Understanding systems and software is hard, but understanding humans and their relationships is so much harder. Working with humans is more art than science, more sensing than reasoning, requiring continual learning and adjustment to thrive. 

And when engineers thrive, we see world-class software delivery and team performance.
